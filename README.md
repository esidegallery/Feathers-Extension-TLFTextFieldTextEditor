# Feathers Extension TLFTextFieldTextEditor 0.0.1

Say hello to [Feathers Extension TLFTextFieldTextEditor](https://github.com/pol2095/Feathers-Extension-TLFTextFieldTextEditor).
This project add a TLFTextFieldTextEditor control to Feathers UI, a library of light-weight, skinnable, and extensible UI controls for mobile and desktop. The components run on Starling Framework and the Adobe Flash runtimes, offering blazing fast GPU powered graphics to create a smooth and responsive experience. Build completely standalone, native applications on iOS, Android, Windows, and Mac OS X, or target Adobe Flash Player in desktop browsers.<br />
Text that may be edited at runtime by the user with the TextInput component, using the native flash.text.TLFTextField class with its type property set to flash.text.TextInputType.INPUT. When not in focus, the TextField is drawn to BitmapData and uploaded to a texture on the GPU. Textures are managed internally by this component, and they will be automatically disposed when the component is disposed.<br />
For desktop apps, TLFTextFieldTextEditor is recommended instead of StageTextTextEditor. StageTextTextEditor will still work in desktop apps, but it is more appropriate for mobile apps.
